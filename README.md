# react-me
The game itself is up and running at [u-react.herokuapp.com](http://u-react.herokuapp.com)


This is a game all about testing your reaction speed, in a game like environment!


The first part of my JS code is initializing variables used later in the code.
The functions after that using .mouseenter and .mouseleave are for the start
page, where if the 'circle', 'square', or 'curvy box' text is hovered over
a shape of that type will appear on the top of the screen.
The .click functions after that .fadeOut the page that the button was clicked on
and .fadeIn(s) the next page. The page path goes Start Page to Difficulty
to Block Number to the Actual Game to the Final Stat page. The final stat page also
includes a survey that you could take to help me improve the game!
The first function after the page loaders is about making the boxes. It includes code to make it a random size, place it randomly in the game zone, and make it a random color.
It also handles the WIN function of the game. After that is the hideBox function, which hides a box when you click on it. At the end of the hideBox function it runs the make function, which makes the box and then loops over and over.
The code after that includes function for special clicks, and other events in the game.
Email me at gcc@ameritech.net if you have any questions on my code!
